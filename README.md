# Lebron Roboto - an Iteractive March Madness Data Console
This is a project for my DS 3002 class to make an ETL data processor. As I began creating it, it evolved into a sort of terminal based chat bot. I had a lot of fun making it and hope to use the knowledge that I learned in creating this to further some of my recent work in automating data encoding.
